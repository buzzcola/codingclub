# Teaching Notes

I haven't taught in a classroom before, or taught children. So I have a lot to learn here. Here are some notes about my experiences so far.

## Class Structure
What's the best way to organize a one-hour weekly coding class? Here's what I've been trying so far:

  * Welcome, and please tell me your names again. I don't have a teacher's knack for memorizing the kids names. I hope they're not too offended.
  * Review of previous weeks' material. There are a lot of details to learn on this subject, so I try to repeat myself as much as possible. After a few minutes of rehashing concepts I feel like the kids get back up to speed.
  * Something fun! We take some time to take a look at something interesting. So far we've looked at a real video game written in python and taken a tour of Github, the social coding site.
  * Then on to the main task: we pick up where we left off in the textbook and work on some code together to create or improve a game.

## Missing Required Skills (Children)

Although the new generation is often referred to as "digital natives", it appears the children's primary experiences with computing are the curated experiences of tablets and phones. I've found them surprisingly unprepared for real computer use in a few areas.

I'll try to incorporate an introduction to these topics in future classes.

### Window Management
Using an operating system like Windows, Linux or OSX often involves managing windows: rectangles that contain programs, like a web browser. They can be resized, maximized, minimized and closed.

### Typing
I don't expect the children to be able to touch-type 100 words per minute, but I was surprised that a number of them struggled with moving the cursor around a document and editing text.

### Files and Folders
This is the primary way that data is organized and accessed on a computer, and must be understood for the type of work we're doing in this class.

## Missing Required Skills (Me)
I didn't realize what a challenge it would be to manage eight children ages 9-12 for one hour. I have a new respect for elementary school teachers who teach much larger groups all day long.

When I move around around the room to help children with individual problems, I find that by the time I finish the room has gone out of control. Bringing everybody back to focus turns out to be a big job.

I've spoken to some of my friends who are school teachers and I have a few new strategies to try.
