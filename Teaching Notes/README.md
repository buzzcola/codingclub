## Back to Basics
This week we learned about copying and pasting text, in our ongoing effort to get these kids up to speed on basic computing skills. We're now just about at a place where I can instruct the kids to grab a python file from the club github directory, copy it and paste it into a new file in IDLE... and in a few minutes, with a few desk visits, be up and running. Not too shabby.

## Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms
We learned about the classic computer game "Snake" and how its simple rules and controls make it a great candidate for experimenting with machine learning.

Then we watched [a video of a simple AI learning to play the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIkBYwdkuTk). We talked (at a very high level) about neural networks and genetic algorithms, which the kids seemed to understand once we watched generation after generation of AI "Snakes" improve their strategy incrementally.

We talked about how it would probably be easier to just write a program that plays Snake perfectly, but that this was an example of a different idea - a program that "learns" over time.

## Joke Telling and Dragon Realm
We got through the next two programs in the textbook.

[jokes.py](https://github.com/buzzcola/codingclub/blob/master/Week%2005/jokes.py) is a very simple program that tells a few jokes and just waits for the user to hit Enter to move to the next section. We learned some new tricks about string delimiters, escape characters, and the "end" optional parameter on the print() function.

[Dragon Realm](https://github.com/buzzcola/codingclub/blob/master/Week%2005/dragonrealm.py) brought in a few of new ideas, the most important being how to define your own functions.

We managed to spend some time with both of these programs before time ran out for the day.

Next week I'd like to focus on writing some new code - we had great focus and made progress this week, but we only read and discussed code. Next is the point in the book that introduces debugging, which should be fun.

## Highlights

I had some great questions and answers from the kids this week, indicating that they're really paying attention - 
  * I asked - why do you think python allows string qualification using interchangable single or double quotes?
  * The kids correctly guessed that it allowed you to make a string with a single or double quote inside.
  * I was then asked what to do when you need to define a string that contains both. Excellent question! This let right into the next topic of escape characters.
  * Once again a great question - how do you escape escape characters?

## Order and Chaos

I started the class by talking to the kids about our behaviour and expectations. Last week was pretty rough, and this was my attempt to get things back on track. I asked that we work together to make a good learning environment for everybody, and that we keep to one person talking at a time. This seemed to work and today went a lot better. I think I'll repeat this at the start of every class from now on.

## Back to Basics
I introduced a new section today called Back to Basics: quick lessons to get the kids up to speed on the general computing skills they will need to get started in programming.

This week it was about using the keyboard to edit a document. I had noticed a lot of kids hammering away at the arrow buttons to try and get the cursor where they wanted it, or having trouble inserting a line or a tab in the right place.

We talked about the Home, End and Delete keys, and how to use Ctrl-Home/Ctrl-End to move to the beginning/end of a document. There were a lot of "oohs" and "ahhs". Next week I'll show them about copying and pasting text.

## Squeakernet FLP
For our "Something Fun" segment, we looked at an [automated cat feeder project](https://github.com/buzzcola/squeakernet) that I built last year. Much like our earlier look at [shmup](https://github.com/kidscancode/gamedev/blob/master/shmup/shmup-24.py), most of the code was beyond the kids' level but we were still able to identify things that we recognized and learn about how the program worked. 

This was wildly popular, which is predictable since it includes videos of cats.

## Guessing Game
Our main task for the class was to complete our number guessing game that we started in Week 2. We had just enough time to get the final features in.

## Memorable Quotes
  * *"I'm looking at the code and I can see how it's going to work without running it."*
  * *"This is the coolest game I've ever made!"*
  * *"Hah! it's five fifteen, I'm not finishing my program, see you later losers!"*

# September 25th, 2019

I haven't taught in a classroom before, or taught children. So I have a lot to learn here. Here are some notes about my experiences so far.

## Class Structure
What's the best way to organize a one-hour weekly coding class? Here's what I've been trying:

  * Welcome, and please tell me your names again. I don't have a teacher's knack for memorizing the kids' names. I hope they're not too offended.
  * Review of previous weeks' material. There are a lot of details to learn on this subject, so I try to repeat myself as much as possible. After a few minutes of rehashing concepts I feel like the kids get back up to speed.
  * Something fun! We take some time to take a look at something interesting. So far we've looked at a real video game written in python and taken a tour of Github, the social coding site.
  * Then on to the main task: we pick up where we left off in the textbook and work on some code together to create or improve a game.

## Missing Required Skills (Children)

Although the new generation is often referred to as "digital natives", it appears the children's primary experiences with computing are the curated experiences of tablets and phones. I've found them surprisingly unprepared for real computer use in a few areas.

I'll try to incorporate an introduction to these topics in future classes.

### Window Management
Using an operating system like Windows, Linux or OSX often involves managing windows: rectangles that contain programs, like a web browser. They can be resized, maximized, minimized and closed.

### Typing
I don't expect the children to be able to touch-type 100 words per minute, but I was surprised that a number of them struggled with moving the cursor around a document and editing text.

### Files and Folders
This is the primary way that data is organized and accessed on a computer, and must be understood for the type of work we're doing in this class.

## Missing Required Skills (Me)
I didn't realize what a challenge it would be to manage eight children ages 9-12 for one hour. I have a new respect for elementary school teachers who teach much larger groups all day long.

When I move around around the room to help children with individual problems, I find that by the time I finish the room has gone out of control. Bringing everybody back to focus turns out to be a big job.

I've spoken to some of my friends who are school teachers and I have a few new strategies to try.
