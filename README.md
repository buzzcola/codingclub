## About Me
I'm James Orr, a professional computer programmer and product manager working here in Burlington. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and I've been working in the field for 17 years. I'm a volunteer with Burlington Public Library and I'm excited to see what we can accomplish together.

I've never taught a class before, so this is a learning experience for me too. I'm going to write down my teaching notes in this repo as a way to keep track of my own progress.
