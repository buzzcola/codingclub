# Coding Club II at Burlington Public Library

Welcome to the official Coding Club II repo! You can browse the files in this repository to get the content we work on in class.

We've had two great sessions of Coding Club so far. When the library opens again we'll fire up another one.

## Curriculum

Our textbook for this course is [Invent your own Computer Games with Python, 4th edition](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/) by Al Sweigart. Mr. Sweigart has written a number of excellent educational books and makes them freely available to everyone. You can support him by buying a print or eBook copy (follow the link above for details.)

## Hey Parents

I've been approached by some parents who would like to know what they can do to keep their child moving forward with their learning.

Kids are welcome to continue working through our textbook on their own time. You'll need a desktop or laptop computer of some kind to do this. The introduction to the book explains how to install the required software. If you get stuck, let me know and I can help.

See the Teaching Notes link above - there are a number of basic skills that many of the children could improve on: basic keyboard/typing skills, using Windows or a similar desktop operating system, and working with files and folders.

If our textbook isn't the right thing, search the internet - there are many different educational resources out there, including videos, articles and books. Find the thing that works best for you and go with it.

Zed A. Shaw's book [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) is a pretty great way to dive in to coding with a ton of hands-on exercises (don't be scared off by the name.) You can try the first few chapters for free.

[Kids can Code](http://kidscancode.org/lessons/) has a really nice set of lessons with videos for making games.

Thanks to everyone who took part and helped with the class. See you soon!

## About Me
I'm James Orr, a professional computer programmer and product manager working here in Burlington. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and I've been working in the field for 17 years. I'm a volunteer with Burlington Public Library and I'm excited to see what we can accomplish together.

I've never taught a class before, so this is a learning experience for me too. I'm going to write down my teaching notes in this repo as a way to keep track of my own progress.
