# Coding Club Week 7

This week we're doing something new! We're going to work in groups. And you're going to write code by yourselves!

Instead of posting code, today I've posted the *output* of two programs. Take a look and try to form an idea of how this program would work. Then write it!

Everything you might need to write these can be found in previous weeks' code, so feel free to browse through our older programs for hints.

# Part 1: The Name Game

`What is my name?`

*bruno*

`Nope!`

`What is my name?`

*nerfron*

`Nope!`

`What is my name?`

*frank*

`How did you know?! You win!`

(bonus: pick a random name instead of the same name every time.)

# Part 2: The Dice Roller

`Press Enter to roll the dice`

*\<enter>*

`You rolled a 3. Press Enter to roll again or "q" to quit...`

*\<enter>*

`You rolled a 6. Press Enter to roll again or "q" to quit...`

*q*

`ya ok see you later!`

(bonus: roll two dice instead of 1.)

# Bonus: The Shopping List

`What do you want to buy?`

*bacon*

`bacon

What do you want to buy?`

*eggs*

`bacon
eggs

What do you want to buy?`

*milk*

`bacon
eggs
milk

What do you want to buy?`

(etc.)
